# Trial Blender Addons
This is a repository that contains addons for Blender specifically for creating models and levels for use with the [Trial engine](https://shirakumo.org/projects/trial).

## Installation
You can [download the latest release](https://github.com/Shirakumo/trial-blender-addons/releases/latest/download/SHIRAKUMO_trial_extensions.zip) directly here from GitHub. You can then import the zip files into Blender just like any other addon and activate it.

Activating it should give you a new menu entry under ``Add`` to create trigger volumes, as well as new action properties specific to Trial. Finally, it hooks into the glTF2 plugin to properly export and import the extra data.
